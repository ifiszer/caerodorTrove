	<element name="Ring of Bilocation" type="Magic Item" source="Paradigm Arcanis" id="ID_CUST_RING_BILOCATION">
		<description>
			<p>This ring consists of a band of polished gold set with two rubies of equal size and color.</p>
			<p>While worn, as an action you may create an illusory double of yourself adjacent to you, dressed and equipped with quasi-real copies of your clothing and equipment. All magical items you are wearing are reproduced on the double as non-magical replicas. The double appears to be the same creature as you but it has half your hit point maximum. Otherwise, the double uses all of your statistics, with adjustments for any loss of benefits from magical items.  While the double is active, you may communicate with it telepathically up to a range of up to 1 mile and it cannot act except by your express command. The double lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful so it can never increase in level or regain expended spell slots.  If the double is damaged, you cannot repair it by any means. While you have an active double you cannot use this ring to create another one. After 6 hours, or if your attunement to the ring ends, the double dissipates into mist and you may not be use this ability again until the following dawn. </p>

			<ul>
				<li> Shadow’s Embrace: While in complete darkness, you may use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to become one with the shadows, effectively becoming invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell. </li>
				<li>Shadow Step: As a bonus action you can expend 1 charge to cast shadow step.</li>
				<li>Shadow Servants: As an action you may expend 2 charges to summon 2 shadows.

The shadows are under your control and are friendly to you and your companions. If you do not issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise do nothing.</li>

	    <description>
	      <p>During a short or long rest, you can summon a contract detailing any agreement filled with your exact stipulations and requests. Any creature that signs the contract is bound by an obligation to fulfill the terms of the agreement for as long as the contract exists or until the terms are completed. If you break the agreement, you lose Gilt equal to three times your  31 character level. If the amount lost is higher than your current total, you suffer force damage equal to twice the difference. If a creature other than you breaks the agreement, you can choose to spend an amount of Gilt equal to or less than five times your warlock level, dealing force damage equal to the amount spent to all offending parties. Once you either break the contract or inflict damage using this feature, the contract is destroyed and can no longer be enforced. You can have a maximum number of contracts in existence at one time equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>

  <element name="Programmed Illusion" type="Spell" source="Player’s Handbook" id="ID_CUST_SPELL_PROGRAMMED_ILLUSION">
    <supports>Sorcerer</supports>
    <description>
      <p>You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes. When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again. The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance. The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.</p>
